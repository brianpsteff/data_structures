After everything finishes compiling you will have a static library
you can link against with any C/C++ program. When you are compiling your 
program just include a -L./libdstructs.a; For example:

gcc -o myprog myprog.c -L./libdstructs.a

Make sure to include the header(.h) file definition inside your program!
